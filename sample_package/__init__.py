# This is the __init__.py file. It indicates that the containing directory
# is a python package which should contain modules and other subpackages.
# Any code written here is executed when the containing package is imported.

# These files can be left empty and exist simply to tell the interpreter that 
# the directory should be considered a python package. It's also a common place
# to put certain constants or sometimes small helper functions.
